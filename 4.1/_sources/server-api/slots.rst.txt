Slots
=====

As you write patterns for voice and text commands, you can add slots to them. Slots are essentially 'variables' in user’s utterances: they represent variable pieces of information you expect to occur in the user's input.

Slots allows Alan AI to identify and retrieve important facts from the user’s speech. By having this data, the AI assistant can respond to the user's request appropriately. For example, when building a weather assistant, you can capture the user's location and date with slots so that the assistant can provide the correct forecast.


Alan AI allows using the following slot types:

-  **User-defined slots** to capture custom values. You can define values for this slot type in several ways:

   - :doc:`Provide a static list of values <user-defined-slots>`
   - :doc:`Create a dynamic list of values <dynamic-slots>` to be updated in runtime
   - :doc:`Use regex <regex-slots>` to capture letter or digit combinations or any user's input

-  **Predefined slots** to :doc:`capture standard data types<predefined-slots>` like user's location, time, numbers and so on.

.. note::
   
   You can add a maximum of 5 slots of any types to the command pattern.
