App source code
---------------

The app source code is available on `Alan AI GitHub <https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-flutter/tree/master/examples/ShrineApp>`__. To use the code example:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Explore the app in the IDE and run it.
3. In the app, tap the Alan AI button and say:

   - ``Show accessories``
   - ``Order stella sunglasses``
   - ``Checkout``

Where to find the code?
-----------------------

To understand how the AI assistant works, refer to the following resources:

- `ShrineApp/lib/app.dart <https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-flutter/blob/master/examples/ShrineApp/lib/app.dart>`__: here you can find the main assistant logic implemented in the client app: the code for the Alan AI button, handlers and client API methods.
- In Alan AI Studio, add the ``Example: Flutter Shrine`` sample project. Here you can find the dialog scripts used for the Shrine app.
