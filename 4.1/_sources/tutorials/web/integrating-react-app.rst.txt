Building a voice assistant for a React app
==========================================

With :doc:`Alan AI SDK for Web <../../client-api/web/react>`, you can create a voice assistant or chatbot and embed it to your React app. The Alan AI Platform provides you with all the tools and leverages the industry’s best Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Speech Synthesis technologies to quickly build an AI assistant from scratch.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple voice enabled React app. The app users will be able to click the voice assistant button and give custom voice commands, and Alan AI will reply to them.

What you will learn
-------------------

-  How to add a voice interface to a React app
-  How to write simple voice commands for a React app

What you will need
------------------

To go through this tutorial, make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.

Step 1. Sign up for Alan AI Studio
----------------------------------

First, we need to sign up for Alan AI Studio — the web IDE where we will create the dialog script for our voice assistant.

1. Go to Alan AI Studio.
2. Sign up with a Google or GitHub account or with your email address.

   .. note::

      When you sign up to Alan AI Studio, Alan adds free interactions to your balance to let you get started. To get additional interactions to your balance, link your Alan AI account with your GitHub account and give stars to `Alan AI repositories <https://github.com/alan-ai>`__. For details, see :ref:`Adding free interactions <Adding free interactions>`.

3. In Alan AI Studio, click **Create Project**. Select to create an empty project and give it any name you want.

Step 2: Create a React app
--------------------------

Now let's create a simple React app.

1. On your machine, navigate to the folder in which the app will reside and run the following command:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Terminal

      npx create-react-app my-app

2. Switch to the folder with the app:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Terminal

      cd my-app

3. Start the app:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Terminal

      npm start

   .. image:: /_static/assets/img/web-frameworks/react-starter-app.png

Step 3: Install the Alan AI Web component
-----------------------------------------

We need to add the Alan AI Web component to the app. In the app folder, install the Alan AI Web component with the following command:

.. code-block::
   :caption: Terminal

   npm i @alan-ai/alan-sdk-web


Step 4: Add the Alan AI button to the app
-----------------------------------------

Now we need to update our app to add the Alan AI button to it.

1. In the ``src`` folder, open the ``App.js`` file.
2. At the top of the file, add the import statement for the Alan AI Web component: 

   .. code-block::
      :caption: React app

      import alanBtn from "@alan-ai/alan-sdk-web";
	
	
3. We will use the Effect Hook to add the Alan AI button to our app. At the top of the file, add the following import statement:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :caption: React app

      import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

   .. note:: 
      For an app that uses React Class Components, you can add the Alan AI button with ``componentDidMount()``. For details, see :doc:`React <../../client-api/web/react>`.

4. In the function component, call ``useEffect``:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :caption: React app

      function App() {
          // Adding the Alan AI button
          useEffect(() => {
              alanBtn({
                  key: 'YOUR_KEY_FROM_ALAN_STUDIO_HERE',
                  onCommand: (commandData) => {
                      if (commandData.command === 'go:back') {
                          // Call the client code that will react to the received command
                      }
                  }
              });
          }, []);
      }

5. In the ``key`` field above, we need to replace ``YOUR_KEY_FROM_ALAN_STUDIO_HERE`` with the Alan AI SDK key for our Alan
   Studio project. In Alan AI Studio, at the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**, copy the value provided in the **Alan SDK Key** field and paste this value to ``key``.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :caption: React app

      function App() {
          useEffect(() => {
              alanBtn({
                  key: '28b4365114e0f2f67d43485dbc3cb44a2e956eca572e1d8b807a3e2338fdd0dc/stage',
                  onCommand: (commandData) => {
                      if (commandData.command === 'go:back') {
                          // Call the client code that will react to the received command
                      }
                  }
              });
          }, []);
      }

Step 5. Add voice commands
--------------------------

Let's add some :doc:`voice commands <../../server-api/commands-and-responses>`  so that we can interact with our React app through voice. In Alan AI Studio, open the project and, in the code editor, add the following intents:

.. code-block:: alan
   :caption: Dialog script

   intent(`What is your name?`, p => {
       p.play(`It's Alan, and yours?`);
   });

   intent(`How are you doing?`, p => {
       p.play(`Good, thank you. What about you?`);
   });

Now in the app click the Alan AI button and ask: ``What is your name?`` and ``How are you doing?`` The AI assistant will give responses provided in the intents.
