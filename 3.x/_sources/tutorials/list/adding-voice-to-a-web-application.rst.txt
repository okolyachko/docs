Building a voice assistant for web (JavaScript)
===============================================

With :doc:`Alan AI's SDK for Web <../../client-api/web/vanilla>`, you can create a voice assistant or chatbot and embed it to a web app, website or webpage. The Alan AI Platform provides you with all the tools and leverages the industry’s best Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Speech Synthesis technologies to quickly build an AI assistant from scratch.

In this tutorial, we will voice enable a simple webpage. You will be able to click the AI assistant button on the page, give custom voice commands and get the AI assistant responses.

What you will learn
-------------------

-  How to create a dialog script with simple voice commands
-  How to test dialog scripts in Alan AI Studio
-  How to add the Alan AI button to a website


What you will need
------------------

This is a getting started tutorial. No prior knowledge is required.


Step 1. Sign up for Alan AI Studio
----------------------------------

First, we need to sign up for Alan AI Studio — a web IDE where we will create the dialog script for our voice assistant.

1. Go to `Alan AI Studio <https://studio.alan.app/>`__.
2. Sign up with a Google, GitHub account or with your email address.

   .. note::

      When you sign up to Alan AI Studio, Alan AI adds free interactions to your balance to let you get started. To get additional interactions to your balance, link your Alan AI account with your GitHub account and give stars to `Alan AI repositories <https://github.com/alan-ai>`__. For details, see :ref:`Adding free interactions <Adding free interactions>`.

3. In Alan AI Studio, click **Create Project**. Choose to create an empty project and give it any name you want.


Step 2: Add voice commands
--------------------------

Now we will add simple voice commands to the dialog script.

1. In the code editor, add the following :ref:`intents<Intent>`. An intent is a voice command the user can give to receive a voice response or trigger some activity in the client app.

   .. code-block:: alan
      :caption: Dialog script

      intent(`Hi`, reply(`Hello`));
      intent(`Who are you?`, reply(`I'm Alan, your AI assistant`));

2. Save the changes.
3. You can test your dialog script in the :doc:`Debugging Chat <../../usage/guides/debugging-chat>` area in the right part of the screen. Type the voice commands in the text box and press **ENTER**. You will be able to see the AI assistant responses which you have defined. You can also click the Alan AI button in the bottom right corner and test your commands with voice. Say ``"Hi"`` or ``"Who are you?"``, and you will hear the AI assistant response.

Step 3: Add the Alan AI button to a client page
-----------------------------------------------

For simplicity, we will add the Alan AI button to an HTML page.

1. At the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**.

2. Scroll down to the **Embed Code Example** section. Here you can find instructions on how to add the Alan AI button for different platforms.

3. On the **JavaScript** tab, click **Copy all** and save the copied code as a new HTML file.

4. Open the file in the browser. You will see an empty page with the Alan AI button in the bottom right corner.

   .. image:: /_static/assets/img/quickstart/quickstart_step7.png

5. Click the Alan AI button and give commands that you have defined.

.. note:: 
   The page will work with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge. You will need to give microphone access after clicking the Alan AI button. Some browsers may block microphone access on unsecured pages or allow it only during the current session.

Congratulations! You've created your first voice-enabled app and learned how to test dialog scripts in Alan AI Studio. Find more examples in the ``Tutorials`` section.
