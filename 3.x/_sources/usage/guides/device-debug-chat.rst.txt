Debug chat on iOS and Android devices
=====================================

With the debug chat provided as part of the Alan AI SDKs, you can test and debug your assistants directly in the apps launched on iOS and Android devices. The debug chat is a chat panel that allows you to monitor how your assistant operates and track comprehensive information in the real time.

To be able to use the debug chat, `enable it in Alan AI Studio <#enabling-the-debug-chat>`__. After that, you will be able to `launch and use it on the device <#using-the-debug-chat>`__.

1. In Alan AI Studio, go to **Integrations**.
