Alan AI projects
================

To start creating an AI assistant in Alan AI Studio, you need to create a project for it. One project contains one or more dialog scripts for a single AI assistant. If you want to add conversational experiences to several apps, you need to create a separate project for each of them.

Managing a project
------------------

To create a project:

1. Sign in to Alan AI Studio.
2. In the main view, click **Create Project**. 
3. Select to create an empty project or choose an example project provided by Alan AI --- **Web Chat Example** or **Voice Assistant Example**.
4. If you create an empty project, in the **Project Name** field, enter the project name and click **Create**.

You can add predefined scripts to your project or create custom scripts for your app. For details, see :doc:`Dialog scripts <scripts>`.

If necessary, you can rename or delete a project.

-  To rename a project, in the top right corner of the project widget, click the options icon and select **Rename**.
-  To delete a project, in the top right corner of the project widget, click the options icon and select **Delete**.
   
.. warning::

	When you delete a project, all scripts you have in the project are permanently deleted. You may want to save your scripts beforehand. For details, see :ref:`Exporting scripts`.
	
Restarting a project
--------------------

In some cases, you may need to restart the project dialog on the server side, in the Alan AI Cloud. This can happen, for example, if the dialog freezes up and fails to respond at all. When you restart a project, Alan AI closes the dialog container and restarts the dialog in a new one.

.. note::

   The dialog container is restarted for a specific environment â€” Development, Testing or Production.

To restart a project:

1. In Alan AI Studio, open the project.
2. At the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**.
3. At the top of the view, select the environment for which you want to
   restart the project: **Development**, **Testing** or **Production**.
4. At the bottom of the view, click **Restart Virtual Machine**.
