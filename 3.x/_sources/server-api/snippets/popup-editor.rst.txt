Alan AI Studio comes with the popup editor -- a tool that allows you to preview UI widgets, such as buttons, cards and Alan AI button popups, and edit their code in a convenient way.

To open a UI widget in the popup editor:

1. In the code editor, to the left of ``showPopup()``, click the edit icon. 
2. If you have several popups in the dialog script, in the left pane, select the widget you want to preview.
3. To prettify the code, at the top of the editor, click **Format HTML**, **Format CSS** and **Format Params**. 
4. Edit the HTML, CSS code and update ``params`` data if needed. 
5. In the lower part of the editor, select the platform and device on which you want to preview the element. You can preview the element on a single device or choose to display all versions at once: browser, tablet and mobile.
6. To change the background, click the **Device background** color picker and choose the color. 
7. To save the results, at the bottom of the left pane, click **Save changes**.

.. note::
   To be rendered in the popup editor, the ``params`` object should only contain numbers, strings, Boolean values or arrays/objects constructed with these values. If your ``params`` object contains other types of values, the popup editor will fail to generate a real-time preview for your data. 
   You can edit the params data directly in the editor. Mind, however, that these changes will not be saved.
