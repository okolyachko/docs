-  **connected**: a connection to the AI assistant project in the Alan AI Cloud is established
-  **disconnected**: a connection to the AI assistant project in the Alan AI Cloud is closed
-  **invalid-auth-response**: an invalid authentication response is received

.. note::
   
   At present, the ``onConnectionStatus`` handler is supported only for the Web platform (including cross-platform frameworks, for example, Ionic).
