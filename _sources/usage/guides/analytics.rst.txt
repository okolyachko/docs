Conversational analytics
========================

As your customers interact with an AI assistant, Alan AI captures voice data and analyzes key conversational metrics. You can access this information and use it to:

•	Understand the users’ behavior and flows
•	Identify unrecognized utterances and unhandled requests and find shortcuts to let users get faster with the voice
•	Optimize the AI assistant effectiveness and create more personalized conversational experiences

To mine and analyze conversational data, use the following tools in Alan AI Studio:

-	:doc:`Projects dashboard <dashboard>`
-	:doc:`Analytics View <analytics-view>`
-	:doc:`Alan AI Studio logs <logs>`

.. toctree::

   <div id="blue-background"></div>
