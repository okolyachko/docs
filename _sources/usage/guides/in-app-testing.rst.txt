In-app testing
==============

Beside testing your AI assistant project in Alan AI Studio, you can also check how your AI assistant works on mobile devices and evaluate the conversational experience.

There are two ways to test your project using mobile:

-  `With your app <#testing-with-your-app>`__
-  `With Alan AI Playground <#testing-with-alan-playground>`__

.. note::
   To perform in-app testing, make sure the :ref:`Enable QR code reader <Enabling the QR code reader>` option is on for the required platform.

If you have already embedded the AI assistant in your app, you can test newer versions of the dialog script with it.

1. In Alan AI Studio, at the bottom of the Debugging Chat, click the **Scan QR** icon. The QR code for your project will be sent to the chat.
2. On your mobile device, launch the app.
3. In the app, tap the Alan AI button and hold it for 8 seconds. The camera app will be launched.
4. Scan the QR code in the Debugging Chat with the device camera. The ``Mobile device connected`` message will be sent to the Debugging Chat.
5. In your app, tap the Alan AI button and give user's commands available in the dialog script of your project. The given commands and replies will be sent to the Debugging Chat, and you will be able to review the output in a convenient way.
