Versions and environments
=========================

To update your AI assistant in an organized way and control the release process, you can use versions and environments in Alan AI Studio.

Script versions
---------------

If a dialog script goes through many iterations, you can create multiple script versions in Alan AI Studio. A script version is a copy of the script made at a particular point in time. Script versions are immutable: once created, they cannot be modified.

To create a script version: 

1. In Alan AI Studio, open the AI assistant project. 

2. At the top of the code editor, click **Save as New Version**. 

3. In the **Version name** field, specify the name for the created version. 

4. (Optional) To run the script version in the Test or Production environment, enable the **Run on Testing** and/or **Run on Production** option.

5. Click **Save**.

You can manage script versions in the following way: 

- To edit the version name, open the versions list, hover over the necessary version and to the right, click the edit icon. Then rename the script version. 
- To delete a script version, open the versions list, hover over the necessary version and to the right, click the delete icon. 
- To roll back to a specific script version, in the versions list, select the necessary version and click **Save to Last Version** to the right. 
- To compare two script versions, at the top of the code editor, click **Compare** and select the script versions to compare.

.. note::

   - If you have multiple scripts in the project, operations with script versions affect all project scripts. For example, if you delete a script version for one script, the same version will be deleted for other scripts, too. 
   - You cannot delete a script version running in the Production environment.

Environments
------------

Alan AI Studio offers three different environments to develop, test and run your script:

-  The Development environment allows you to work on the dialog script, fix bugs and add new features to the script
-  The Testing environment can be used to test your AI assistant
-  The Production environment can be used to roll out the finalized script version to production

You can deploy different script versions to different environments. To do this:

1. In Alan AI Studio, at the top of the code editor, select the environment in which you want to run a script version.
2. In the versions list to the right, select the script version.
3. At the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**.
4. In the **Alan SDK Key** field, check the last segment of the key value. It will refer to the environment you have selected.
5. In the **Embed Code Example** section, click **Copy** to copy the code for the Alan AI button.
6. Embed the copied code to the application to be run in the necessary environment.
