Alan AI Studio
--------------

Alan AI Studio is a web IDE that allows developers to write dialog scripts for their AI assistants. Alan AI Studio offers a suite of tools for script building, testing, and deploying AI assistants, including:

-  :doc:`Source code editor <../guides/scripts>`
-  :doc:`Testing and debug tools <../guides/script-testing>`
-  :doc:`Versions and environments <../guides/versioning>`
-  :doc:`Alan AI Analytics <../guides/analytics>`

Alan AI SDKs
------------

Alan AI SDKs can let you integrate the AI assistant into your apps and websites. Alan AI provides SDKs for several platforms and frameworks:

-  :doc:`Web frameworks <../../client-api/web/web-api>`: :doc:`React <../../client-api/web/react>`,
   :doc:`Angular <../../client-api/web/angular>`, :doc:`Vue <../../client-api/web/vue>`,
   :doc:`Ember <../../client-api/web/ember>`,
   :doc:`JavaScript <../../client-api/web/vanilla>`,
   :doc:`Electron <../../client-api/web/electron>`
-  :doc:`iOS <../../client-api/ios/ios-api>`: Swift and Objective-C
-  :doc:`Android <../../client-api/android/android-api>`: Kotlin and Java
-  :doc:`Cross-platform frameworks <../../client-api/cross-platform/overview>`: :doc:`Flutter <../../client-api/cross-platform/flutter>`, :doc:`Ionic <../../client-api/cross-platform/ionic>`, :doc:`React Native <../../client-api/cross-platform/react-native>`, :doc:`Apache Cordova <../../client-api/cross-platform/cordova>` 

Once you integrate your AI assistant with the Alan AI SDK, you will see a small draggable button on top of the app's UI. The Alan AI button allows users to bring up the Alan AI Chat, start and end dialog sessions and indicates the processing state.

After integration, you will not need to rebuild or modify your app. If you need to enhance your AI assistant, simply update the dialog script in Alan AI Studio. All changesÂ will be applied in real time, without the need for users to restart their apps.
