Starting and stopping dialog sessions
=====================================

To start a dialog session with the AI assistant, you need to activate it in the app. You can do it in the following ways: 

- Click or tap the AI assistant button displayed on top of the app UI.
- Use the wake word. Make sure the :ref:`wake word option <Using the wake word>` is enabled for your AI assistant project.
- Use the :ref:`activate()` method of the Alan AI SDK to activate the AI assistant programmatically.

To deactivate the AI assistant and stop the dialog session, do either of the following: 

- Click or tap the AI assistant button 
- Say one of the following phrases: 

  - ``Thanks Alan``
  - ``Thank you Alan``
  - ``Alan thank you``
  - ``Alan thanks``
  - ``Stop Alan``
  - ``Alan stop``
  
- Use the :ref:`deactivate()` method of the Alan AI SDK to deactivate the AI assistant programmatically

  .. note::
     You can deactivate the AI assistant with voice only while Alan AI is listening to you. If you say one of the above phrases while Alan AI is saying something, the AI assistant will not be deactivated.
