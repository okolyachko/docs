Intent-driven dialogs
=====================

To let users accomplish tasks with text or voice commands or get a response from the AI assistant, you can add intents to the dialog script. In Alan AI, intent is a function that allows it to identify the goal or purpose behind the userâ€™s utterance and take the appropriate action. For example, when building an AI assistant for flight booking, you may want to include the following intents:

- ``Search for available flights``
- ``Book an flight``
- ``Reserve a seat``

Intent-driven dialogs are best suited when the user's goal is well-defined, the dialog is structured and follows a rigid path. A typical dialog script will combine both tools and functions for intent-driven and intentless dialogs, such as :doc:`question answering <qna>`.

You can use the following Alan AI tools to design intent-driven dialogs:
