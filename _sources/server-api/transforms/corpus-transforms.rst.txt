Corpus transforms
=================

Assume you have information on a webpage and want Alan AI to use it to answerÂ questions. The AI assistant's responses should be formatted in a specified manner.
 
For this, you can do the following:

1. To the dialog script in Alan AI Studio, add the ``corpus()`` function, specify the data source and the name of the transform that will be used to format the answer. In this example, we will use a transform named ``events``.

   .. code-block:: alan
      :caption: Dialog script

      corpus({
          urls: [        
              `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status`,                
         ],
         transforms: transforms.events
      });  	  
   
2. Under **Transforms**, create a transform named ``events``. Leave it empty for now.

3. Use the Debugging Chat to ask questions you want to be transformed, for example: ``What does code 304 mean?``

4. In the code editor, to the left of the ``transforms`` function, click the magnifying glass icon. This will open the :doc:`Transforms Explorer <transforms-explorer>`.

5. The Transforms Explorer displays the results of data transformation. To the right of an example, click the plus icon to add the result to the ``events`` transform.

6. Under **Transforms**, select ``events``. The added transform result can be found under **Examples**. In the **Result** field, edit the **Full Answer** and **Links** sections to format the ``corpus()`` output as needed.

Now, you can ask questions about the status codes and see how the set formatting rules are applied to the ``corpus()`` output:
