Q&A service
===========

With Alan AI's Q&A service, you can quickly build an AI-powered Q&A assistant that will leverage your data sources, both static and dynamic, to address user queries. The Q&A service employs a combination of question answering, semantic search and code generation by AI to automatically deliver relevant responses and maintain multi-turn contextual conversations.

The Q&A service can be helpful if you already have a pool of information that you want to use to:

-	Handle user requests
-   Offer 24/7 automated support
-	Onboard new customers and employees
-	Provide instructions, training and so on

The Q&A service is a low-code solution that enables you to build a Q&A AI assistant with minimal coding. It only requires you to specify your data sources and a few parameters. Once configured, the Q&A service automatically crawls the data sources and ingests the information from them to create a private knowledge memory for your AI assistant, which is then used to converse with users. 

When building a Q&A AI assistant, you can combine diverse types of data sources.  The Q&A service accepts the following data formats:

- Web pages
- Plain text
- PDF
- JSON data
