Troubleshooting
===============

To troubleshoot problems you may have with your Ionic app, check the solutions below:

-  For Mac or Linux, you may need to run commands with ``sudo``.

-  On the iOS platform, you need to disable Bitcode for your app builds. For details, see `Disable Bitcode for Capacitor iOS <https://ionic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051851074-Disable-Bitcode-for-Capacitor-iOS>`__.

-  You can encounter the following problem while running Capacitor: ``unknown option ‘–npm-client’``. Uninstall Ionic and install its latest version:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Terminal

      npm uninstall -g ionic
      npm install -g @ionic/cli@latest
