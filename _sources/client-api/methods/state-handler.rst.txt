onButtonState handler
=====================

Responsible for handling the Alan AI button state change events.

When the user launches an app with the Alan AI button, Alan AI connects to the project in the Alan AI Cloud, and the Alan AI button transitions through
several states:

-  **CONNECTING**: Alan AI is connecting to your AI assistant project in the Alan AI Cloud
-  **ONLINE**: a connection to the project is established
-  **LISTEN**: Alan AI is listening to the user input
-  **PROCESS**: Alan AI is processing the user input
-  **REPLY**: Alan AI is replying to the user
-  **OFFLINE**: no connection to the Internet; the connection to the Alan AI Studio project cannot be established
-  **NO_PERMISSION**: permission for the microphone has not been received from the user
-  **NO_VOICE_SUPPORT**: voice is not supported on the device
-  **INSECURE_ORIGIN**: the website or app does not have a secure origin and Alan AI is not able to access the microphone on the device

If you need to perform activities in the app while the Alan AI button is in a specific state, you can use the ``onButtonState`` handler to listen to the Alan AI button state changes.
